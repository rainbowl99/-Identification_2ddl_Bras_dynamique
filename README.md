# Identification_2ddl_Bras_dynamique
The main focus of the project is the practice of positional control of a planar robot manipulator with two degrees of freedom. The focus of the project is the implementation and tuning of a PID controller to achieve precise control of the robot manipulator. This included tuning the PID parameters and analyzing the nonlinearities and mechanical coupling of the system. The project also involved identifying and quantifying the effects of various dynamic terms in the system such as dry friction, gravity, inertial coupling and centrifugal coupling.<br>
This was followed by position control of a two-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator. This involved setting up decentered PID controllers for each axis and analyzing the performance of this type of controller. Adjustments to the dynamics of the robot model are included, as well as experiments to analyze and quantify the effects of system nonlinearities and mechanical coupling.<br>
